		why: 'Project produced in the scope of the Typography curricular unit.',
		what: 'This work consisted in the creation of a brochure, in which the theme would be an event for a cultural institution. With this in mind, I chose the event "Quebra Jazz". An urban jazz festival, on one of the most unexpected stages: a staircase located in the city of Coimbra known as "Quebra costas". Every weekend of the summer, with several artists performing, individually or in groups. As for the editorial material itself, it should consist of an 8-page booklet.',

		what: 'The project consists in developing the graphic identity of the annual conference cycle. This cycle brings, as guests, several professionals to present various areas of work, which are connected with Design and other creative areas. This project was developed together with my colleague Mariana Ferreira.Our idea when creating the graphic identity was to develop numerous abstract figures by perturbing the movements of several sets of lines. Each figure would have an intense color to highlight its silhouette.',
